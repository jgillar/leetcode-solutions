        Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that
        they add up to a specific target.

        You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you
        may not use the same element twice.

        My solution is extremely basic. We start with the first number in the
        array and then check it against each remaining number to see if the sum
        is equal to the target. This is repeated until a match is found.
