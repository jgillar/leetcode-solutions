  Okay maybe this problem was a little too easy. All I did was use a simple
  regular expression. Using JavaScript's built-in functions is almost always
  going to be faster than implementing your own string replacement functions so
  I didn't see a need to do that. Plus it's always good to get more practice
  with regular expressions.
