title: 1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value
---

<p>
  Despite being a Medium difficulty problem, this one was actually pretty easy.
  My solution for this is recursive. We start with the root of the tree. If it's
  a leaf node with the target value, we're done. Otherwise, we look at its left
  and right nodes. If both of those are leaves with the target value, then they
  will be removed and the current root node will also become a leaf. If it has
  the target value, then remove it. That's basically it. Every time we remove a
  node, we have to make sure that change "bubbles up" the tree.

  Let there be n nodes in the tree. We examine each node exactly once. So, the
  running time for this is just O(n).
