title: 177. Nth Highest Salary
language: sql
---

<p>
  This one is basically the same as the 2nd Highest Salary problem, only this
  time instead of using a hardcoded value for the offset, we have a variable
  now. We get the unique salaries and sort them so they're in order. Then we
  select the one at offset N-1 since OFFSET is from the first row.
