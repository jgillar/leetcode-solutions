title: 1317. Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers
---

<p>
  My solution is to just brute force it. We iterate over integers n down to 1
  and stop as soon as we find two valid summands.

  I think there's a better way to do this with some number theory but I think
  that's really overcomplicating things. I may revisit this problem if I can
  think of a really neat solution.
