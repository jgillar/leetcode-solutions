title: 27. Remove Element
---

<p>
  The idea here is to only keep track of the valid numbers as we iterate over
  the array. We have a lagging pointer that only advances when we see a valid
  number. When we find a new valid number, we override the lagging pointer with
  it. If we see an invalid number, we skip over it and don't do anything. As we
  are only iterating over the array once, the running time is O(n) where n is
  the length of the nums array.
</p>
<p>
  My first idea was to simply switch the invalid number with whatever the next
  element in the array was. This actually worked well until an array had two
  invalid numbers in a row. Then I realized it would just be easier to look at
  the valid numbers instead of the invalid ones.
