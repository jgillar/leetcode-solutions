title: 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies
---

<p>
  Usually I write my solutions in JavaScript but I decided to do PHP for this
  one.
</p>
<p>
  My solution is basic. All we do is find the highest number of candies in
  <code>$candies</code> and determine which values in the array are greater than
  that number when added to <code>$extraCandies</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The running time is simply <code>O(n)</code> as we are only iterating over the
  <code>$candies</code> array once. There is also a call to
  <code>max()</code> and I am assuming that also just iterates over the array
  and doesn't do anything special. My method was the first that came to mind but
  I can't think of a better algorithm to do this.
