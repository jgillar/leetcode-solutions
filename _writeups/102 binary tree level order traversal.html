  This is basically just breadth-first search. The only difference here is that
  we need to keep track of which nodes are in which level so it's not as simple
  as just regular BFS. To start, we create a queue for nodes we discover as we
  traverse the tree and enqueue the root. We then add the root to the list of
  nodes on the current level. Then enqueue the root's children and add the list
  of nodes at that level to the main list of lists of nodes. We then "move" to
  the next level and repeat this process until the queue is empty.

  We visit every node in the tree exactly once so the running time is just O(n)
  where n is the number of nodes.
