title: 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
---

<p>
  This was a straightforward one. We take the middle element of the array and
  create a new node from it. Then we look at the left half of the array and
  create a new node from that and point the current node to it. Repeat for the
  right half of the array. It's basic recursion. The running time is simply
  <code>O(n)</code> since we're just iterating over the initial array exactly
  once.
