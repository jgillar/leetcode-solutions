title: 2. Add Two Numbers
---

<p>
  Since the digits are stored in reverse order, the algorithm is basically the
  same exact one you use to add two numbers in real life. My solution involves
  three pointers, one for each linked list and then an additional one pointing
  to whichever linked list is currently being traversed since there is no
  gaurentee that both linked lists are the same length. We iterate over each
  integer in the lists and keep track of the carry digit as we go.

  This problem wasn't exactly difficult but it was deceptively complicated.
  You'd expect it to be really easy because it's just basic operations with
  linked lists and grade school arirthmetic. The hardest part was making sure to
  carry through the carry digit when you reached the final digits of the lists,
  like for 99+1 and you end up with a three digit number. At that point, both
  pointers will be null so we end up needing to check for that during every
  single iteration.

  Anyway we iterate over each list only once, the running time will just be
  O(l1.length, l2.length). Since we never make any dummy nodes, the space
  complexity is the same.
