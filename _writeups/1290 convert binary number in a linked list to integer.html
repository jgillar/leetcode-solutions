title: 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer
---

<p>
  When you convert a binary number to base 10 by hand, you usually start with
  the last digit and not the first. At least that's what I do anyway. But since
  these are stored as linked lists and the digits are in normal order, you can't
  do that. Instead another algorithm would consist of repeatedly multiplying by
  2. It's literally the reverse of how you convert from base 10 to binary.

  The running time is just O(n) where n is the number of digits in the binary
  number.
