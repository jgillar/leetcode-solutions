title: 169. Majority Element
---

<p>
  If we have a sorted array and we know ahead of time that there will be an
  element that appears more than n/2 times, then we know for sure that the
  median element of the array will be that element.
</p>
<p>
  JavaScript uses quicksort for its sort() implementation so the running time
  for this solution is simply O(nlogn).
