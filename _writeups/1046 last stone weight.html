<p>
  There was a hint to use a heap so that's what I used. I implemented a max heap
  and after that the problem became trivial. All we do is repeatedly remove the
  first two elements and insert their difference.
</p>
<p>
  Let n be the number of elements passed in. Converting the array into a heap
  can is done in linear time but I'm not going to reiterate why because I
  remember the proof is long and and I don't feel like typing it up in LaTeX.
  It's a really nice proof though. I definitely did not appreciate it while I
  was still taking Data Structure in college. I didn't really get it until I
  took a few upper level math classes.
</p>
<p>
  So anyway, to build the heap from the given input is O(n). Then for every two
  elements we remove, we add insert another into the heap. An upper bound for
  the number of insertions would be n-1 and an upper bound for the number of
  removals would be 2n-1. Each removal and insertion takes O(logn) time so the
  running time for this is O(nlog).
