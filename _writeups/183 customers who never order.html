title: 183. Customers Who Never Order
---

<p>
  This one was easy. We just do a LEFT JOIN which on the Customers table. A LEFT
  JOIN returns every row in the first table along with any matched records in
  the second. Not every single record in the first will have a match but if it
  doesn't, it will still be in the joined table. That means a LEFT JOIN is
  perfect for figuring out which records are in the first table but not the
  second.
