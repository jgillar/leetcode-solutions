title: 771. Jewels and Stones
---

<p>
  This was a simple problem. First we split the jewel and stone strings into
  arrays. Then we iterate over each jewel and count the number of times it
  occurs in the stone array. The running time would be O(js) where j is the
  length of the jewel string and s is the length of the stone string.
</p>
<p>
  If we check if the stone string contains the jewel before iterating over it,
  we improve the running time slightly. With this optimization, the time is 56ms
  versus 60ms without. It's still going to be O(js) though. I'm trying to think
  of an even better way to do this problem but I think this might be the
  simplest way.
