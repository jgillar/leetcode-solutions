title: 69. Sqrt(x)
---

<p>
    This is simple. We start at 1 and iterate over integers until we reach one whose square is 
    larger than <code>x</code>. The running time is also simply <code>O(sqrt(x))</code>. 
    To put that into perspective since <code>O(sqrt(n))</code> doesn't show up as often as 
    <code>O(logn)</code>, <code>O(n^2)</code>, etc. in algorithm analysis,  <code>O(sqrt(n))</code> 
    ncreases more rapidly than  <code>O(logn)</code> but significantly less than  <code>O(n)</code>.
