title: 1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix
---

<p>
  There is nothing particularly special about my solution. First we set up the
  array of 0s. Then we iterate over the indices array and increase each
  specified row/column. As we do this, we check if the current element is odd
  and increase the counter if it is.
</p>
<p>
  The running time for setting up the array is probably O(n*m) unless
  JavaScript's built in function for Array.fill() runs in constant time. The
  running time for actually solving the problem will be O(l*m + l*n) where l is
  length of the indices array.
