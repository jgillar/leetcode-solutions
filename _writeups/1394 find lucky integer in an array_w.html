title: 1394. Find Lucky Integer in an Array
---

<p>
  For this problem I just used a simple hash map where the key-value pairs are
  <code>(k, frequency(k))</code> where <code>k</code> is some integer in
  <code>arr</code>. We iterate over the array and increment the counter for each
  value. Then after that we iterate over the keys in the map to actually find
  the lucky integers which is when for the key-value pair
  <code>(k, frequency(k))</code>, <code>k == frequency(k)</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Iterating over the array is <code>O(n)</code> where <code>n</code> is the
  length of the array. Inserting into and retrieving from the hash map is
  <code>O(1)</code> so amortized <code>O(n)</code> overall to record all the
  array values and their frequencies. To locate the lucky integers, we iterate
  over the keys of the hash map. In the worst case, <code>arr</code> consists of
  only unique integers so the map contains <code>n</code> keys so iterating over
  them is <code>O(n)</code>. All in all, the entire running time is simply
  <code>O(n)</code>.
