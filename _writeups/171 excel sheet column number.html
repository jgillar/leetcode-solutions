title: 171. Excel Sheet Column Number
---

<p>
  This was a cute little problem. We're basically working with base 26, so a
  string like ABC would be A*26^2 + B*26^1 + C*26^0. The algorithm is exactly
  the same as converting binary to decimal only we work with powers of 26
  instead of 2.

  I liked this problem a lot even if it was easy. I never thought about why
  Excel's columns are named the way they are before. I mean I always made the
  connection that you had columns A-Z and then AA, AB, etc. for 27, 28, etc.
  It's just that this really made me realize it's a lot easier typing, say,
  CATS9 instead of having to type something like 53943,9. Though I'm not sure
  what kind of spreadsheet would have 50,000+ columns. Apparently Microsoft has
  asked this question in some of their coding interviews. I find that really
  nice for reason.

  So anyway, since we iterate over each letter of the string exactly once, the
  running time for this algorithm is just O(n) where n is the length of the
  string.
