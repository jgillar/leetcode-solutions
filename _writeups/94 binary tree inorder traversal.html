title: 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
---

<h4>Recursive</h4>
<p>
  This problem is ranked as Medium because it asks you for two solutions, one
  recursive and one iterative. The recursive one is easy and the iterative one
  is trickier. I wanted to do both. The recursive one is extremely
  straightforward. For a given node, we look at the subtree and traverse that.
  Then we look at the node's value. Then we look at the right subtree.

<h4>Iterative</h4>

  This way is more complicated. I initially tried this by searching for the
  leftmost leaf and keeping an array of all nodes visited along the way as well
  as the level of the tree. This worked for some of the test cases that I tried
  but not all of them, namely the ones with more than two levels. I wasn't sure
  where to go from there so I looked at the solution and it said to use a stack.
  That's almost what I was doing and I can't believe I didn't think of that.
  Looking back I'm not sure why I wanted to keep track of the level rather than
  just look at the parent node was. Also, I know what you're thinking and no, I
  didn't look at the code. Just the diagram.

  Anyway, here's the algorithm. We start at the root of the tree. We push the
  current node onto the stack. Then we move to the left subtree and repeat this
  process until we reach a leaf node. At this point we move back upwards to the
  node on top of the stack. Since the left subtree for that node has already
  been traversed, we move down to the right subtree. We repeat this entire
  process until the stack is empty.
