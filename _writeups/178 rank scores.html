title: 178. Rank Scores
---

<p>
  This one was very easy to implement but kind of hard to come up with the
  solution for It took me awhile to realize that if we just look at the unique
  salaries in the table, you can very easily figure out the rank. For any score,
  its rank is just the number of scores larger than it. So if the score is rank
  1, then it's the largest. By only considering the unique scores in the table,
  we never have to deal with 'gaps' in rank when there are duplicates. This kind
  of tripped me up at first. The ranks of my scores would look something like 1,
  2, 2, 4, ... Simply looking only at distinct scores instead completely fixed
  everything.
