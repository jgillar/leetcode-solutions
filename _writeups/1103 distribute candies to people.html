title: 1103. Distribute Candies to People
---
      <p>
        My solution is simple. We create an array of num_people and then iterate
        over the number of candies. The running time will be O(max(candies,
        num_people)).

      <p>
        One interesting thing I noticed while submitting my solution is that
        it's a little bit faster to keep a running total of the number of
		candies given away versus calculating the total using x(x+1)/2. Also, 
		it's significantly faster to do
		<pre>arr[x % num_people] += x + 1;</pre>
		rather than
		<pre>arr[x % num_people] = arr[x % num_people] + x + 1;</pre>
		I know it's because when you assign through +=, the system only has to access that memory location once versus twice the other way. Normally I always use += but for whatever reason, I forgot this time. I just wanted to point that out here because it was kind of cool seeing just how much of a difference it makes. The first way yields a runtime of 48ms/faster than 97% of other JavaScript solutions versus 60ms/40% faster than other solutions. 12ms does not seem like a huge difference but I imagine when you're dealing with massive datasets and you don't have unlimited resources to process them, that difference will matter.
