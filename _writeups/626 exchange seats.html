  I had to think about this one for awhile but actually writing the solution was
  easy.

  My first thought was to join the table with itself and look at each possible
  pair of students and swap the ones with conscutive ID numbers. But then I
  realized that's unnecessary. You can just directly change the ID numbers.
  That's it. Odd numbered IDs get their ID increased by one, even number IDs get
  them descreased by 1. If you have an odd number of students, you can't
  increase their ID since that would mean you have an extra student out of
  nowhere. So instead we just leave it alone.
