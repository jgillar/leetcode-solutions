title: 371. Sum of Two Integers
---

<p>
  This was actually kind of difficult despite it being marked as an easy
  problem. I feel like I had a vague idea about how to go about this one only
  because of a similar problem I had to do back in college. If I had never done
  that problem I don't think I could have come up with a solution for this.
</p>
<p>
  I tried an example with <code>11</code> and <code>3</code> so I could think
  about how to 'transform' the summands into what their sum should be.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  1011
+ 0011
= 1110
</pre>
</p>
<p>If we start to add the two number together like you normally would, 
	we would start with the rightmost bits and do <code>1+1=10</code>. 
	Another way to think about it is  <code>1+1=0</code> and we have to 
	carry the <code>1</code>. How would we actually carry that <code>1</code>?
	We just shift it left just like if you were calculating the sum by hand.
<pre>
  1
+ 1
= (carry 1)0
= 10
</pre>
</p>
<p>So how do we know which bits will result in a carry? If we look at the example again it's easy to see we will need to do carrying
	for the 3rd and 4th bits.
<pre>
  1011
+ 0011
= 10(carry 1 + (1+1))0
= 1(carry 1)10
= 1110
</pre>
</p>
<p>When both bits to be summed are <code>1</code> it will result in a carry. 
	 We could  use <code>&</code> the bitwise AND operation to locate these bits.
<pre>
  1011
& 0011
= 0011
</pre>
Then to actually 'do' the carrying, we simply shift the bits left.
<pre>
  0011 << 1
= 0110
</pre>
</p>
<p>
	But this isn't exactly what we want. It's close but not quite. 
	The leftmost digit is still wrong. If we think about how we add
	the bits by hand again, we notice that <code>1+0=1</code> and 
	<code>1+1=(carry 1)0</code>. This looks similar to a bitwise operation, 
	in particular bitwise XOR <code>^</code>.
<pre>
  1011
^ 0011
= 1000
</pre>
The first leftmost bit is correct but the second two aren't. We will need 
to combine XOR and AND and shifting to get the result we want.
</p>
<p>So to summarize this so far since I'm really bad at explaining things,
	when we add two bits together they result in either <code>1</code> or 
	<code>0</code> without needing to carry or <code>0</code> and 
	needing to carry. When at least one bit is <code>0</code>, 
	there will be no carry and we can compute that sum by using 
	<code>^</code> XOR. To locate the bits where carrying occurs, 
	we can use <code>&</code> AND. To actually 'do' the carrying, 
	we <code><<</code> shift the bits left by 1 position.
</p>
<p>So for the example of <code>11</code> and <code>3</code>,
<pre>
  1011
& 0011
= 0011

  0011 << 1
= 0110

  1011
^ 0011
= 1000
</pre>
</p>
<p> So what do we do with these resulting numbers? We add them again. Why?
	We are adding the result of adding the numbers together without carrying 
	and the results of just carrying.  
<pre>
  0110
& 1000
= 0000

  0000 << 1
= 0000

  0110
^ 1000
= 1110
</pre>
</p>
<p>There are no bits left to carry so we're done. Also observe that we got 
	the right answer, 14.
