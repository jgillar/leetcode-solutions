title: 46. Permutations
---

<p>
  I'm using recursion for this. I tried an iterative solution first and it got
  extremely messy extremely quickly. We take an element of the given array and
  build up a permutation by recursively inserting the remaining elements into
  the permutation array. The running time for this O(n!) sadly. I can't think of
  another algorithm that's better than this and I'm not sure there is simply
  because we're dealing with permutations.
