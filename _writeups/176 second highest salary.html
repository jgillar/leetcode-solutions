title: 176. Second Highest Salary
---

<p>
  This one was easy. We simply select all the unique salaries and sort them so
  they're in order. Then we just select the one with an offset of 2.
</p>
<p>
  By the way, the OFFSET/FETCH syntax for MS SQL is so overly verbose and super
  reundant. In mySQL all you need is LIMIT and OFFSET. None of this FETCH
  FIRST/NEXT x ROW/ROWS stuff. And what's worse is that FIRST/NEXT are literally
  the same, same with ROW/ROWS.
