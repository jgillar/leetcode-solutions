          You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.</p>

          <p>
          You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.</p>

        My solution is extremely basic. We start with the first number in the
        array and then check it against each remaining number to see if the sum
        is equal to the target. This is repeated until a match is found.
