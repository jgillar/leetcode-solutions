      <p>
        Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value
        in-place and return the new length.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by
        modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave
        beyond the new length.
      </p>

    <section>
      <pre>
		removeElement([3,2,2,3], 3);
		Result: <span id="ts-1"></span>
		Note: remember that elements beyond the new length do not matter

        The idea here is to only keep track of the valid numbers as we iterate
        over the array. We have a lagging pointer that only advances when we see
        a valid number. When we find a new valid number, we override the lagging
        pointer with it. If we see an invalid number, we skip over it and don't
        do anything. As we are only iterating over the array once, the running
        time is O(n) where n is the length of the nums array.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first idea was to simply switch the invalid number with whatever the
        next element in the array was. This actually worked well until an array
        had two invalid numbers in a row. Then I realized it would just be
        easier to look at the valid numbers instead of the invalid ones.
