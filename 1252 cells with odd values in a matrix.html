        Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings,
        where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the
        elements are emails representing emails of the account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely
        belong to the same person if there is some email that is common to both
        accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may
        belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person
        can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts
        definitely have the same name.
      </p>
      <p>
        After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format:
        the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the
        elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be
        returned in any order.

        There is nothing particularly special about my solution. First we set up
        the array of 0s. Then we iterate over the indices array and increase
        each specified row/column. As we do this, we check if the current
        element is odd and increase the counter if it is. The overall running
        time is O(n*m + l) but since l will usually be less than n*m, the
        running time is essentially O(n*m).
