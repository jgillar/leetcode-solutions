        Given n and m which are the dimensions of a matrix initialized by zeros
        and given an array indices where indices[i] = [ri, ci]. For each pair of
        [ri, ci] you have to increment all cells in row ri and column ci by 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        Return the number of cells with odd values in the matrix after applying
        the increment to all indices.

        There is nothing particularly special about my solution. First we set up
        the array of 0s. Then we iterate over the indices array and increase
        each specified row/column. As we do this, we check if the current
        element is odd and increase the counter if it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        The running time for setting up the array is probably O(n*m) unless
        JavaScript's built in function for Array.fill() runs in constant time.
        The running time for actually solving the problem will be O(l*m + l*n)
        where l is length of the indices array.
