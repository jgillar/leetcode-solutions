      <p>
        Given an integer n. No-Zero integer is a positive integer which doesn't
        contain any 0 in its decimal representation.
      </p>
      <p>Return a list of two integers [A, B] where:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A and B are No-Zero integers.</li>
        <li>A + B = n</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It's guarateed that there is at least one valid solution. If there are
        many valid solutions you can return any of them.

        My solution is to just brute force it. We iterate over integers n down
        to 1 and stop as soon as we find two valid summands.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think there's a better way to do this with some number theory but I
        think that's really overcomplicating things. I may revisit this problem
        if I can think of a really neat solution.
