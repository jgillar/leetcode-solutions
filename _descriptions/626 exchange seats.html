      Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table
      <code>seat</code> storing students' names and their corresponding seat
      ids.
    </p>
    The column <b>id</b> is continuous increment.

    <p></p>
    Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.

    <p></p>
    Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?

    <p></p>

    <pre>
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
</pre
    >
    For the sample input, the output is:

    <p></p>

    <pre>
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
</pre
    >

    <p>
      <b>Note:</b><br />
      If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last
      one's seat.
