        Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value
        of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds
        the binary representation of a number. Return the decimal value of the
        number in the linked list.

        When you convert a binary number to base 10 by hand, you usually start
        with the last digit and not the first. At least that's what I do anyway.
        But since these are stored as linked lists and the digits are in normal
        order, you can't do that. Instead another algorithm would be by
        repeatedly multiplying by 2. It's literally the reverse of how you
        convert from base 10 to binary.
      </p>
      <p>
        The running time is just O(n) where n is the number of digits in the
        binary number.
