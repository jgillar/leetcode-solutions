      <p>
        Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings,
        where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the
        elements are emails representing emails of the account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely
        belong to the same person if there is some email that is common to both
        accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may
        belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person
        can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts
        definitely have the same name.
      </p>
      <p>
        After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format:
        the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the
        elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be
        returned in any order.

        After thinking about this problem some more, I think a much better
        solution would be to just use a graph. For something simple like this,
        it's kind of overkill but in a real world application where the data is
        huge, it would be much better. I might revisit this problem and redo it
        in the future.
