        You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels,
        and S representing the stones you have. Each character in S is a type of
        stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are
        also jewels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S
        are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a
        different type of stone from "A".

        This was a simple problem. First we split the jewel and stone strings
        into arrays. Then we iterate over each jewel and count the number of
        times it occurs in the stone array. The running time would be O(js)
        where j is the length of the jewel string and s is the length of the
        stone string.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we check if the stone string contains the jewel before iterating over
        it, we improve the running time slightly. With this optimization, the
        time is 56ms versus 60ms without. It's still going to be O(js) though.
        I'm trying to think of an even better way to do this problem but I think
        this might be the simplest way.
