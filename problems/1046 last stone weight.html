        <p>
          We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer
          weight.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each turn, we choose the two <strong>heaviest</strong> rocks and smash
          them together.  Suppose the stones have weights <code>x</code> and
          <code>y</code> with <code>x <= y</code>.  The result of this smash is:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>If <code>x == y</code>, both stones are totally destroyed;</li>
          <li>
            If <code>x != y</code>, the stone of weight <code>x</code> is
            totally destroyed, and the stone of weight <code>y</code> has new
            weight <code>y-x</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this
          stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)
        </p>

        <p></p>

        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

        <pre><strong>Input: </strong>[2,7,4,1,8,1]
<strong>Output: </strong>1
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.</pre>

        <p></p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

        <ol>
          <li><code>1 <= stones.length <= 30</code></li>
          <li><code>1 <= stones[i] <= 1000</code></li>
        </ol>

      <h2>My Solution</h2>
      <h3>Example Testcase</h3>
      <pre>
        Input: [4,7,6,5,4]
        Expected Output: 2
        Actual Output: <span id="result"></span></pre>

      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        There was a hint to use a heap so that's what I used. I implemented a
        max heap and after that the problem became trivial. All we do is
        repeatedly remove the first two elements and insert their difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let n be the number of elements passed in. Converting the array into a
        heap can is done in linear time but I'm not going to reiterate why
        because I remember the proof is long and and I don't feel like typing it
        up in LaTeX. It's a really nice proof though. I definitely did not
        appreciate it while I was still taking Data Structure in college. I
        didn't really get it until I took a few upper level math classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        So anyway, to build the heap from the given input is O(n). Then for
        every two elements we remove, we add insert another into the heap. An
        upper bound for the number of insertions would be n-1 and an upper bound
        for the number of removals would be 2n-1. Each removal and insertion
        takes O(logn) time so the running time for this is O(nlog).
