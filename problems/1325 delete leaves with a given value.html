        Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf
        nodes with value target. Note that once you delete a leaf node with
        value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value
        target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until
        you can't).

        Despite being a Medium difficulty problem, this one was actually pretty
        easy. My solution for this is recursive. We start with the root of the
        tree. If it's a leaf node with the target value, we're done. Otherwise,
        we look at its left and right nodes. If both of those are leaves with
        the target value, then they will be removed and the current root node
        will also become a leaf. If it has the target value, then remove it.
        That's basically it. Every time we remove a node, we have to make sure
        that change "bubbles up" the tree.
      </p>

        Let there be n nodes in the tree. We examine each node exactly once. So,
        the running time for this is just O(n).
