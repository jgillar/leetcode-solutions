        Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP
        address. A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

        Okay maybe this problem was a little too easy. All I did was use a
        simple regular expression. Using JavaScript's built-in functions is
        almost always going to be faster than implementing your own string
        replacement functions so I didn't see a need to do that. Plus it's
        always good to get more practice with regular expressions.
