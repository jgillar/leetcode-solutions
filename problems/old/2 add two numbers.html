    <h1>2. Add Two Numbers</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative
        integers. <strong>The digits are stored in reverse order</strong> and
        each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and
        return it as a linked list.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except
        the number 0 itself.

          let l1 = (9, 9, 9, 9);
          let l2 = (1);
          addTwoNumbers(l1, l2);
          Result: <span id="ts-1"></span>

        Since the digits are stored in reverse order, the algorithm is basically
        the same exact one you use to add two numbers in real life. My solution
        involves three pointers, one for each linked list and then an additional
        one pointing to whichever linked list is currently being traversed since
        there is no gaurentee that both linked lists are the same length. We
        iterate over each integer in the lists and keep track of the carry digit
        as we go.
      </p>
      <p>
        This problem wasn't exactly difficult but it was deceptively
        complicated. You'd expect it to be really easy because it's just basic
        operations with linked lists and grade school arirthmetic. The hardest
        part was making sure to carry through the carry digit when you reached
        the final digits of the lists, like for 99+1 and you end up with a three
        digit number. At that point, both pointers will be null so we end up
        needing to check for that during every single iteration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway we iterate over each list only once, the running time will just
        be O(l1.length, l2.length). Since we never make any dummy nodes, the
        space complexity is the same.
