          <p>
            Given a column title as appear in an Excel sheet, return its
            corresponding column number.
          </p>

          <p>For example:</p>

          <pre>
    A -> 1
    B -> 2
    C -> 3
    ...
    Z -> 26
    AA -> 27
    AB -> 28 
    ...
</pre

          <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

          <pre><strong>Input:</strong> "A"
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
</pre>

          <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

          <pre><strong>Input: </strong>"AB"
<strong>Output:</strong> 28

        <h3>Example Testcase</h3>
        <pre>
Input:			AB
Expected Output:	28	
Actual Output:		<span id="result1"></span>

Input:			CATS
Expected Output:	53943	
Actual Output:		<span id="result2"></span>
		</pre>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          This was a cute little problem. We're basically working with base 26,
          so a string like ABC would be A*26^2 + B*26^1 + C*26^0. The algorithm
          is exactly the same as converting binary to decimal only we work with
          powers of 26 instead of 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          I liked this problem a lot even if it was easy. I never thought about
          why Excel's columns are named the way they are before. I mean I always
          made the connection that you had columns A-Z and then AA, AB, etc. for
          27, 28, etc. It's just that this really made me realize it's a lot
          easier typing, say, CATS9 instead of having to type something like
          53943,9. Though I'm not sure what kind of spreadsheet would have
          50,000+ columns. Apparently Microsoft has asked this question in some
          of their coding interviews. I find that really nice for reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          So anyway, since we iterate over each letter of the string exactly
          once, the running time for this algorithm is just O(n) where n is the
          length of the string.
