		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			This is a simple bookmarklet made for generating the files needed for my
			writeups on Jekyll-powered website. Instead of copy/pasting everything by
			hand, this extracts the problem description and solution code straight from
			Leetcode and also makes an empty page file complete with front matter
			already added in. It's extremely convienient!
		</p>
		<p><img src="{{'/assets/images/screenshot.jpg' | absolute_url}}" /></p>
		<p>My leetcode solutions site is organized in this way:</p>
		<pre>
		.
		├── _descriptions/
		│   ├── 123 example1.html
		│   └── 456 example2.html
		├── _solutions/
		│   ├── 123 example1.txt
		│   └── 456 example2.txt
		└── _writeups/
			├── 123 example1_w.html
			└── 456 example2_w.html
		</pre>
		<p>
			So the bookmarklet creates <code>xxx name.html</code>,
			<code>xxx name.txt</code>, <code>xxx name_w.html</code> which can easily be
			moved to their respective folders. No special configurations are necessary
			or anything.
		</p>

		<h2>How to use it</h2>
		<p>
			Since it's not a good idea to blindly execute JavaScript in your browser,
			you should look over the
			<a
			href="https://github.com/jgillar/leetcode-solutions/blob/gh-pages/template_generator_jekyll.js"
			>source code</a
			>. Next you can either run that through a minifier and create a bookmarklet
			with that set as your URL or you can simply bookmark the link below (or drag
			it to your bookmark bar).
		</p>
		<p>
			<a class="special-link" id="bookmarklet-link" href=""
			>Leetcode Bookmarklet</a
			>
		</p>
		<p>
			After that, simply go to any leetcode problem you've completed, make sure
			you are viewing the "Description" tab, and click the bookmarklet. Then make
			sure the text is correct and download your files. That's it.
		</p>
